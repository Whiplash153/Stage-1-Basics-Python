# While Loop

**Stage/Topic/Task:** Stage 1 → Syntax → While loop

**Goal:** Learn how to repeat actions while a condition is true and how to avoid infinite loops.

**What I did:**
- Wrote a basic while loop with a counter (1 to 5).
- Built a user-input loop that asks until the condition is met.
- Explored infinite loops and how to avoid them (changing state, using break).
- Practice task: asked user to input numbers, summed them until 0 was entered.

**What I learned:**
- `while` repeats the block while the condition is True.
- Indentation defines which lines belong to the loop.
- `input()` always returns a string; convert to int if doing math.
- Infinite loops happen if the condition never changes.
- You can use `break` to exit a loop early.

**How to run:**
```bash
python 02_syntax/06_while_loop/basic.py
python 02_syntax/06_while_loop/while_input.py
python 02_syntax/06_while_loop/task.py
