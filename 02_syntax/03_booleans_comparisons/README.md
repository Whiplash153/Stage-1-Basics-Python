# Boolean Values and Comparisons

**Stage/Topic/Task:** Stage 1 → Syntax → Boolean values and comparisons

**Goal:** Learn how to work with boolean values (`True`, `False`) and comparison operators.

**What I did:**  
- Compared numbers with `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`  
- Compared strings with `==`  
- Practiced conditions with `if / elif / else`  
- Wrote a practical case: smart AC logic depending on temperature  

**What I learned:**  
- `True` and `False` are results of comparisons  
- `=` is assignment, `==` is comparison  
- Conditions run top to bottom, only first match executes  
- You can nest conditions or split them into separate `elif` blocks  
- Practical logic can be built from simple comparisons  

**How to run:**  
```bash
python 02_syntax/03_booleans_comparisons/check.py
python 02_syntax/03_booleans_comparisons/if_smart_home.py
