# Combinations of Conditions and Loops

**Stage/Topic/Task:** Stage 1 → Syntax → Combinations of conditions and loops

**Goal:** Learn to combine conditions (`if/elif/else`) and loops (`while`) in one program.

**What I did:**
- Created a text menu with options.
- Used `while True` to repeat the menu until the user chooses Exit.
- Used `if/elif/else` to handle user input.
- Implemented real actions:
  - Option 1: ask two numbers and print their sum.
  - Option 2: ask for a password and check it.
  - Option 0: exit the program.

**What I learned:**
- Conditions and loops can be combined to create interactive programs.
- `while True` + `break` is a common pattern for menus and consoles.
- Input from the user is always a string; convert to int for calculations.
- Code after `break` runs once after leaving the loop.

**How to run:**
```bash
python 02_syntax/07_combinations/task.py
```
