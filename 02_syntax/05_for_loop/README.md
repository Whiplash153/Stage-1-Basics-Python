# For Loop

**Stage/Topic/Task:** Stage 1 → Syntax → For loop

**Goal:** Learn how to repeat actions using a for loop.

**What I did:**  
- Wrote a basic loop with `range()` to print numbers from 1 to 10  
- Iterated over a string and a list  
- Used `enumerate()` to get index + value from a list  
- Solved practice tasks:  
  - Summed all numbers in a list and printed only those greater than 10  
  - Filtered words longer than 3 characters and counted them

**What I learned:**  
- `for` takes elements one by one from a sequence (range, list, string)  
- Indentation (tabs/spaces) defines what belongs to the loop body  
- `enumerate()` is useful when you need both index and element  
- You can use variables as accumulators (for sums, counters, etc.) inside loops  
- Loops + conditions = filtering and processing collections in practice

**How to run:**
