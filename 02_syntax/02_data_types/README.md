# Data Types: Numbers and Strings

**Stage/Topic/Task:** Stage 1 → Syntax → Data types (numbers and strings)

**Goal:** Learn how to work with basic data types: numbers and strings.

**What I did:**  
- Wrote arithmetic operations with integers (`+ - * / // % **`)  
- Practiced string operations: concatenation, repetition, length, indexing, slicing  
- Learned how to combine strings and numbers (`,`, `+ str()`, f-strings)  

**What I learned:**  
- Python distinguishes between int (integer) and str (string)  
- Numbers support math operators  
- Strings support concatenation, repetition, indexing, slicing  
- f-strings are the easiest and most readable way to format text with variables  

**How to run:**  
```bash
python 02_syntax/02_data_types/numbers.py
python 02_syntax/02_data_types/strings.py
