# Task 2: methods and attributes

**What I did**  
Extended classes with methods.

**What I learned**  
- Methods are functions inside a class that describe object behavior.  
- `self` allows access to object attributes and other methods.  
- Attributes are data stored inside an object; they can be changed by methods.  

**Practice**  
- In `demo.py`, the class `Person` can greet and celebrate a birthday.  
- In `task.py`, I created a `Dog` class with methods `bark()` and `birthday()`.
