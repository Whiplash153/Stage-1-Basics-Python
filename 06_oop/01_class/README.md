# Task 1: class and object

**What I did**  
Created my first classes in Python: `Person` and `Car`.

**What I learned**  
- `class` defines a new type (a blueprint).  
- `__init__` is called when creating an object and saves data inside it.  
- `self` is the current object, used to access attributes.  
- Objects store data as attributes, accessible with dot notation (`obj.attr`).  

**Practice**  
- In `demo.py`, I created a `Person("Anna", 30)` and printed the attributes.  
- In `task.py`, I created a `Car("Toyota", 2020)` and printed the attributes.
