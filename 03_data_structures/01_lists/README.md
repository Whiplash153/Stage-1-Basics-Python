# Working with Lists

In this task we practiced the basic operations with Python lists.

## What we covered
- Creating lists and accessing elements by index.
- Checking if an element exists (`contains`).
- Finding the position of the first occurrence (`first_index`).
- Counting how many times a value appears (`count_occurrences`).
- Basic statistics on numbers: minimum, maximum, sum, average (`numbers_stats`).
- Reversing a list (`reverse_in_place`).
- Sorting and creating sorted copies (`sorted_copy`).
- Getting the top N largest elements (`top_n`).
- Iterating over lists:
  - element by element (`print_elements`);
  - with index and value (`print_with_index`);
  - building a new list with a loop (`squares`);
  - list comprehension (`squares_comp`, `filter_even`).
- Copying lists:
  - simple assignment (both variables refer to the same list);
  - slicing copy (`[:]`);
  - copy with `.copy()` method;
  - deep copy (`copy.deepcopy`).

## Practical task
Write a function that takes a list and returns its first and last element.

## Conclusion
Lists are one of the most universal data structures in Python.  
We learned how to create, modify, iterate, copy them, and also how to calculate simple statistics and solve practical problems.
