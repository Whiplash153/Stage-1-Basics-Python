# Working with Tuples

In this task we practiced the basics of Python tuples (immutable sequences).

## What we covered
- Creating tuples with multiple elements.
- Accessing elements by index (first, last).
- Mixed-type tuples (strings, numbers, booleans).
- Single-element tuples (with a comma, e.g. `(5,)`).
- Tuple operations:
  - Concatenation (`+`)
  - Repetition (`*`)
  - Membership check (`in`)
- Nested tuples (tuples inside tuples, e.g. a 2x2 matrix).
- Immutability: tuples cannot be modified after creation.

## Practical task
Create a tuple with three favorite movies.  
1. Print the first movie.  
2. Print the last movie.  
3. Check if `"Inception"` is in the tuple.

## Conclusion
Tuples are useful when you need to store a fixed set of values that should not change.  
They are commonly used for coordinates, colors, dates, and structured data that must remain immutable.
