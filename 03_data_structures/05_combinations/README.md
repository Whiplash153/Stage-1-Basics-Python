# Combinations of Data Structures

In this task we practiced nesting Python data structures inside each other.

## What we covered
- **List of dictionaries**: a collection of users where each user is represented by a dictionary with fields (`name`, `email`).
- **Dictionary of lists**: categories as keys and lists of items as values.
- **Dictionary of sets**: users as keys and their roles as sets of permissions.
- **Practice task**: created a dictionary of users and their hobbies, printed data for each user and accessed a specific user's hobbies.

## Conclusion
Combinations of data structures are very common in real projects.  
They allow us to organize complex data in a clear way (like tables, categories, or access rights).
