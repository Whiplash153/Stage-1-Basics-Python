# Task 2: try/except (basic)

**What I did**  
Created a simple program with division by zero inside a `try` block.

**What I learned**  
- `try` lets you run code that might fail.  
- `except` catches the specific error and prevents the program from crashing.  
- Example: `ZeroDivisionError` happens when dividing by zero.

**Practice**  
In `task.py`, I divided 999 by 0 and caught the error with `except`.  
Instead of crashing, the program printed: "Error: divide by zero".
