# Task 1: Errors and Traceback

**What I did**  
Created simple code examples that cause errors.

**What I learned**  
- Python stops execution when it meets an error.  
- The error message (traceback) shows the file, line number, and error type.  
- Common examples:  
  - `NameError` — using a variable that was not defined.  
  - `ZeroDivisionError` — dividing a number by zero.  

**Practice**  
Tried to reproduce one of these errors on my own in `task.py`.
