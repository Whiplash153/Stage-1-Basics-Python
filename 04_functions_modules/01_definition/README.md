# Task: Definition of a function

## What we did
We created our first own function in Python.  
The base example was `hello()`, which simply prints “Hello”.  
Then we added `hello_name(name)`, which accepts an argument and greets a specific person.

## Why it matters
Functions allow us to group code into named blocks.  
Instead of repeating the same commands, we can pack them into a function and call it many times.  
This is the foundation for reusable, clean and structured code.

## Result
- `hello.py` → contains `hello()` function and its call.
- `task.py` → mini-practice: `hello_name(name)` with a personalized greeting.
