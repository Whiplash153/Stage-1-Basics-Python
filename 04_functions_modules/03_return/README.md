# Task 3: Return values from functions

**What I did**  
Learned how to use `return` in Python functions instead of only `print`.

**Key points**  
- `print` just shows the result on the screen and then it is lost.  
- `return` gives the result back to the program so it can be saved or used again.  
- When a function hits `return`, it stops immediately.  

**Practice**  
- Created a function `square(x)` that returns the square of a number.  
- Saved the returned result in variables and used it in further calculations.  
- Wrote a function with an early `return` to show how a function can exit as soon as a condition is met.  
- In the practice file tried different inputs for `square(x)` to see when it returns a number and when it returns `"Invalid size"`.  

**Artifacts**  
- `basic.py` — simple function with `return`  
- `use_result.py` — using returned values in calculations  
- `early_exit.py` — early exit with `return`  
- `task.py` — mini-practice with return
